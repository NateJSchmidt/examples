# TornadoFX Example
This Maven Project contains two example TornadoFX applications.  The project is setup to compile both Java and Kotlin code even though there is only Kotlin code within the project.

## Changing Button Colors
This FX application creats a simple window with a few labels and a button that changes the font color (of the text in the button) when clicked.

## Swapping Views
This FX application creates three views that scroll left and right when the user clicks the various buttons.  It demonstrates the following concepts:
* How to layout basic JavaFX components using the TornadoFX builder paradigm
* How to configure action listeners on the buttons
* How to have, and switch between, multiple stages.
